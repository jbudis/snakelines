With decreasing price of massive parallel sequencing technologies, more and more laboratories are utilizing resulting sequences of DNA fragments for genomic analysis.
An substantial obstacle for interpretation is transforming of sequenced data into results interpretable by clinicians and researchers without computational background.
Laboratories are generally using computational pipelines consisting of several bioinformatic tools.

We propose several computational pipelines for processing of paired-end Illumina reads; including mapping, assembly, viral identification, RNA-seq and metagenomics analysis.
All provided pipelines are embedded into virtual environments that ensures isolation of required resources from host operating system, rapid deployment and reproducibilty of results accross different platforms.
