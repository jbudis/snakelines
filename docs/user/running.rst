Running SnakeLines
==================

SnakeLines are designed to simplify running of complex bioinformatics pipelines without manual install of any additional libraries and bioinformatics tools.
All dependencies are installed using Conda into new virtual environment.
This way, there should be no conflicts between tool already installed on the system and SnakeLines specific configuration.

Minimal software requirements are:

* Linux (tested on Ubuntu 16.04.1)
* `SnakeMake <https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ (tested on 5.2.2)
