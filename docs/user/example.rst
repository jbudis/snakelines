Quick start
===========

This guide will show you the basic usage of SnakeLines pipelines on small toy example.
We assume that you have Linux system installed (tested on Ubuntu 16.04.1).

Install required dependencies
-----------------------------

Follow installation guides for `Miniconda <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html>`_ and `Snakemake <https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html>`_.
There is no need to install any other tools manually.
All required bioinformatic tools are installed automatically by SnakeLines inside dedicated virtual environment to avoid dependency conflicts with already installed tools.

Download SnakeLines scripts
