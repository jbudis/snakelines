Megahit - Assemble Reads Into Contigs
-----------------------------------------

Assemble preprocessed reads into the larger genomic sequences, contigs. Also generate contig overlap graphs and
initial scaffolds. Use 'megahit' program.

**Location**

- *Filepath:* <SnakeLines_dir>/rules/paired_end/assembly/assembler/megahit.snake
- *Rule name:* megahit__assemble_reads_into_contigs

**Input(s):**

- *r1:* gzipped fastq file with left reads
- *r2:* gzipped fastq file with right reads

**Output(s):**

- *contigs:* contigs in .fa file
- *intermediate_contigs:* Assembled contigs with k-mer size 99

**Param(s):**

- *outdir:* output directory (do not change)
- *contigs:* contig file generated by megahit (do not change)

Megahit - Generate Contig Graph
-----------------------------------

Create graph with contigs to visually assess complexity of the assembly
