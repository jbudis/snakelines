AmbiguousRuleException:
Rules samtools__sort_bam_by_position and samtools__sort_mapped_reads are ambiguous for the file mapping/mhv/sorted/example_A_sorted.bam.
Consider starting rule output with a unique prefix, constrain your wildcards, or use the ruleorder directive.
Wildcards:
	samtools__sort_bam_by_position: path=mapping/mhv/sorted,sample=example_A
	samtools__sort_mapped_reads: reference=mhv,sample=example_A_sorted
Expected input files:
	samtools__sort_bam_by_position: mapping/mhv/sorted/example_A.bam
	samtools__sort_mapped_reads: reference/mhv/mhv.fa mapping/mhv/original/example_A_sorted.bamExpected output files:
	samtools__sort_bam_by_position: mapping/mhv/sorted/example_A_sorted.bam
