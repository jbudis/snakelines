RuleException in line 27 of /home/adog/snakelines/rules/nanopore/reads/report/quality_report/nanoplot.snake:
NameError: The name 'read_type' is unknown in this context. Please make sure that you defined that variable. Also note that braces not used for variable access have to be escaped by repeating them, i.e. {{print $1}}
