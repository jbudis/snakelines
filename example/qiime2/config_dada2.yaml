        # When you open the ANCOM visualizations, you’ll see a volcano plot on top, which relates the ANCOM W statistic to 'transform_function' for the groups.
        # The W statistic is the number of ANCOM subhypotheses that have passed for each individual taxon, indicating that the ratios of that taxon’s relative abundance to the relative abundances of W other taxa were detected to be significantly different (typically FDR-adjusted p < 0.05).
        # Because differential abundance in ANCOM is based on the ratio between tests, it does not produce a traditional p-value.
